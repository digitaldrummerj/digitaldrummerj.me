      <p class="teaser">Here you will find a list of available workshop tutorials that I have created. If you would like me to give a workshop at your event, please <a href="/contact/">drop me a line</a>.  I can give on the existing workshops below or create a new one on pretty much any topic you see me blog about but feel free to also request just about anything.</p>

                <p>Creating a RESTful API should be the easiest part of your development. You should not have to be a rocket scientist to successfully create a RESTful API. With Sails, you can create a full featured RESTful API in just a few minutes without writing any code. You get create, destroy, update, find, paginate, sort, and filtering out of the box. If you need to add your business logic to any of the methods or create your own methods, you can do that by writing simple JavaScript functions.</p>
                <p>When you are ready to implement your security layer, Sails has you covered. Sails provides basic security and role-based access in the form of policies that can be applied any REST action. Policies are interchangeable with Express/Connect middleware which means you can plugin in popular NPM modules such as Passport. You can also easily implement your own email/password, social login or Windows authentication with a bit of JavaScript.</p>
                <p>For data storage, Sails bundles the power ORM, Waterline, which provides a simple data access layer that just works, no matter what database you are using. Out of the box MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Redis are support. However, there are more than 30 data storage providers adapter that the community has created such as Microsoft SQL Server, Couchbase, Salesforce, and Firebase. You can easily switch between any data storage provider or mix and match data storage providers on a model by model basis.</p>
                <p>This talk will be code heavy as we walk through getting started with Sails and demonstrate how to implement the features of Sails through the creation of an API. As well, I will share the tips and tricks that I have learned using Sails at a Fortune 100 company. You will walk away understanding how and why you should use Sails on your next project.</p>

                <p>If you have ever wanted to code an application with Angular this is your chance. Join us for a fun filled day of learning Angular in this hands-on workshop. You will go from 0 to 60 with your Angular knowledge and be able to create our own Angular applications by the end of this workshop. We will start with a new project and continue to build up the project until we have a full application at the end.</p>
