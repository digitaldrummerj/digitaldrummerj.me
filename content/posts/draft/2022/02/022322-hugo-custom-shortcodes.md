In our [previous post](/hugo-built-in-shortcodes),  we took a look at Hugo shortcodes whuch ar HTML snippets that you can use as a way to extend the html that is generated by Hugo.  There are several shortcodes built-in to Hugo but you can also easily create your own custom shortcodes.  In this post, we are going to take a look at how to create our own shortcode.

<!--more-->

To create a shortcode you need to create a file in thr layouts\shortcodes folder.

> Consider the file name carefully since the shortcode name will mirror be that of the file but without the .html extension. For example, layouts/shortcodes/myshortcode.html will be called with either {{< myshortcode />}} or {{% myshortcode /%}} depending on the type of parameters you choose.

Shortcodes can also take parameters either as positional (Get 0) or named (Get name)) parameters.

Let's build a bootstrap alert shortcode.

1. Create layouts\shortcodes\alert.html
1. Add the following to alert.html 

	```html 
	<div class=“alert alert-{{ with .Get “class” }}{{.}}{{end}}”>{{ .Inner | markdownify }}</div>
	```
