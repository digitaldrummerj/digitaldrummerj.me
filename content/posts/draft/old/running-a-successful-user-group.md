239

Running a user group or meetup takes a good amount of work to make it successful.   At a minimum you need to worry about figuring out topics, finding speakers, finding a venue, and  getting people to attend.  

Figuring out topics can be a difficult task when you are just getting started since you don't have a user base to get ideas from.
