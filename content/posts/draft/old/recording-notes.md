title: More Recording Notes

* Filming Process
    * Replace the batteries in the microphone
    * Put camera out of the way of the audience if possible.  I tend to put it off to the side and film from the side with as much of a front angle as I can get
    * If wearing lav mic for event, put it on top of the recording microphone
    * If wearing lav mic for event, you will get a slight echo in the recording
    * Snap fingers or clap hands to put a big wave into the audio file to use as an audio sync point
    * Record Camtasia Full Screen with the USB Microphone
    * Set the camera to use auto gain
    * Set the camera to record in 1920x1080
    * Set the microphones in the A/B setting
    * Camtasia: 600 megs to 1 gig per hour for just the screen and microphone
    * Camera: 10-11 gigs per hour
    * Once you stop Camtasia it will open Camtasia.  Save the project file.
    * Stop the camera after you have answered all of the questions.  Sometime I just carry the camera out to the hallway to put everything away.
* Editing Process
    * Copy the files from the SD Card to the Hard Drive
    * Import all of the camera files
    * Add the 1st camera file to the timeline
        * File naming convention
            * 1st file: ZOOM0002.MOV
            * 2nd file: ZO010002.MOV
            * 3rd file: ZO020002.MOV
    * syncing Audio
        1. Zoom into the timeline
        1. Make the camera and camtasia rows taller
        1. Look for the big spike in the audio so that you can really see the wave form of the audio
        1. Turn off the camera footage
        1. In the camtasia screenshot footage find the snapping of the fingers
        1. Put a marker at the point of the 1st snap
        1. Turn off the camtasia screenshot footage and turn back on the camera footage
        1. In the camera footage find the snapping of the fingers
        1. Drag the camera footage over until the snapping of the fingers lines up with the camtasia footage.  Use the marker you created before
        1. Turn on the camtasia footage.
        1. Fine turn the line up of the audio
        1. Play the audio and make sure there is no audio between the 2 audio sources.
    * Add the rest of the video clips in order
    * Separate the camera audio from the video
    * Turn off the camera audio (I keep it around just in case I want any audio from the audience later.  Like questions they might have asked)
    * The view that is rendered in the output is based on the order of the items in the timeline.  the higher in the timeline the more on top of everything it is.
    * Resize the camera video so that you will be able to see the camera and slides together
        * up to you if you want the camera video on top of the sides or if you want to reduce the slide size down and have them side by side.
    * Boost any of the audio that might need it
    * I sometimes add the noise filter on but you have to listen to the audio to make sure that it didn't make it all funky
    * Add an intro
        * Fade into the intro
        * Fade out of the intro
    * Add an outro
        * Fade into the intro
        * Don't fade out of the outro
    * Process the file locally
        * what are my settings?  I go with a super high-def output setting so I get a really large file.
    * Upload to YouTube
        * I do not make paid workshop videos public for everyone unless they have the link.  I feel like the audience paid for the workshop in addition to the conference so I don't want to just give away the videos for free.  If they want to give their friends the link to the videos that is just fine by me.
    * Advertise on Twitter
        * make sure to tag the conference
        * tag any technologies that you used
