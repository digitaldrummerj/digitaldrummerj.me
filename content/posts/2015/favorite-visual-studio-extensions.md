## Resharper

This is the one extension that I cannot live without.  It makes Visual Studio a much better IDE.  Once you start using it, you will wonder how you ever lived without it.  I could easily do several blog post on the features of Resharper.  Below I picked out some of my favorite features.      
  
[http://jetbrains.com/resharper](http://jetbrains.com/resharper)

## Features:

**Navigation**

* Go to Everything / Type - quick navigation to all possible destinations (types, symbols or files).  
* Go to file - quickly navigate to any file within your solution.  
* Go to File member - quickly navigate to a particular method or field in the current file.

Docs:  [https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/navigation_search.html](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/navigation_search.html)

**Code Generation**

* Create from usage
* Generate Type members
* Implement/Override Methods
* Generate formatting or equality members

Docs: [https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/code_generation.html](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/code_generation.html)

**Code Analysis / Refactoring / Code Templates**

* Continuous code quality analysis
* Detect errors and code smells
* Quick fixes
* Code Templates (snippets, surround with, and file)
* Lots of refactoring options:  [https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/code_refactoring.html](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/code_refactoring.html)

**Code Cleanup**

* Code formatting
* Optimize namespace declarations
* Remove code redundancies
* File and type layout
* Code style configuration and sharing

**Camelhumps**

This is not so much a feature but an option that you can turn on.  I like it so much though that I consider it a feature.

When turned on it allows you to auto filter intellisense and any search dialogs by typing the first letter of each capitalized word in what you are looking for.  For example, if you have a class called MyClassExample you would search for it by typing MCE.  

<font color="red">Warning:</font> Camelhumps changes the behavior of Ctrl+Backspace to now  only delete the previous word instead of the whole declaration.  For example, MyClassExample would only delete Example and leave MyClass. 

**Unit Test Runner**

* Run and debug test
* Can run multiple unit test sessions simultaneously and independently of each other 
* Docs: [https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/unit_testing.html](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/unit_testing.html)
