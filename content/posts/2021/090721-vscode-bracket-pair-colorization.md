One of the extensions for VSCode that I have used for the past couple of years is [Bracket Pair Colorizer 2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2) to color each of the bracket pairs a different color so that you can visually see the start/end bracket.

With the VSCode August 2021 (ver 1.60.0) update, this feature is now built into VSCode.  You just need to turn it on.
