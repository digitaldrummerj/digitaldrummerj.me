In several applications I work on, we have a requirement that we are not allowed to delete any data out of the database physically. Instead, when we need to delete a record, we set an IsDeleted column to true and exclude the row from our queries.

In this post, we will be implementing soft deletes on an example project.

<!--more-->

> This post is designed as a step-by-step walkthrough of the implementation. If you just want to look at the finished code, get it [here](https://github.com/digitaldrummerj/efcore-examples/tree/feature/1-soft-deletes)

## Create Sample Project

1. Open a terminal and navigate to where you want to store the example project we are going to create
1. Run dotnet new to create our WebApi project

    ```shell
    dotnet new webapi -o EntityFrameworkExample
    ```

1. cd into the EntityFrameworkExample directory

    ```shell
    cd EntityFrameworkExample
    ```

1. Add a .gitignore file using the dotnet-ignore global tool

    ```shell
    dotnet-ignore get -n visualstudio.gitignore
    ```

    > If you do not have the dotnet-ignore global dotnet tool installed, check out my post on how to install the tool, [here](/dotnet-global-ignore/)

1. Install the EntityFramework Core Sql Server package

    ```shell
    dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
    ```

## Create Tables

Now that our example project is created, we need to create our data model. We are going to create two tables, Blog and Post.

1. Create directory EntityFramework

    ```text
    EntityFramework
    ```

1. Create a directory in EntityFramework called Entities

    ```text
    Entities
    ```

1. Create Blog.cs in EntityFramework\Entities\

    ```text
   Blog.cs
   ```

1. Add the following code to the Blog.cs file to create a Blogs table with two columns and a relationship with the Post table.

    ```csharp
    using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
    using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema;

    namespace EntityFrameworkExample.Entities;

    [Table("Blogs")]
    public class Blog
    {
        [Key, DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]
        public int Id { get; set; }

        [Required]
        [MaxLength(255)]
        public string Name { get; set; }

        [Required]
        [MaxLength(2048)]
        public string Url { get; set; }

        [InverseProperty(nameof(Blog))]
        public List<Post> Posts { get; set; } = new List<Post>();
    }
    ```

1. Create Post.cs in EntityFramework\Entities directory

    ```text
    Post.cs
    ```

1. Add the following code to Post.cs to create the Post table with several columns and the relationship to the Blog table.

    ```csharp
    using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
    using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema;

    namespace EntityFrameworkExample.Entities;

    [Table("Posts")]
    public class Post
    {
        [Key, DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]
        public int Id { get; set; }

        [Required]
        [MaxLength(255)]
        public string Title { get; set; }

        [Required]
        [MaxLength(100)]
        public string Url { get; set; }

        public bool IsDraft { get; set; }

        public string Content { get; set; }

        public int BlogId { get; set; }

        [ForeignKey(nameof(BlogId))]
        public Blog Blog { get; set; }
    }
    ```

## Create Context

Now that our entities are created, we are ready to create our database context for Entity Framework.

1. In the EntityFramework directory, create a file called EntityFrameworkExampleContext.cs

    ```text
    EntityFrameworkExampleContext.cs
    ```

1. In the EntityFrameworkExampleContext.cs file, add the following code to tell EntityFramework about the Blog and Post table.

    ```csharp
    using EntityFrameworkExample.Entities;
    using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
    namespace EntityFrameworkExample;

    public class EntityFrameworkExampleContext : DbContext
    {
        public EntityFrameworkExampleContext(DbContextOptions options) : base(options)
        {
        }

        public DbSet<Blog> Blog { get; set; }

        public DbSet<Post> Post { get; set; }
    }
    ```

## Add Context to ASP.NET Core Startup

Now that we have our tables and EF Core context file, we are ready to add the context to the ASP.NET Core startup.

In Program.cs, we need to add the database context to the Services.

1. Add the following namespaces

    ```csharp
    using EntityFrameworkExample;
    using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
    ```

1. Add the connection string before the call to `var app = builder.Build();`

    ```csharp
    string connectionString = "(localdb)\mssqllocaldb;Database=EntityFrameworkExample;ConnectRetryCount=0;Trusted_Connection=True;";

    builder.Services
        .AddDbContext<EntityFrameworkExampleContext>(opt =>
            opt.UseSqlServer(connectionString));
    ```

    > If you have Visual Studio installed, it comes with the localdb.

### Using Docker for Sql Server

If you do not have Visual Studio installed, you can use Docker to run an instance of Visual Studio and then update the connection string to connect to the docker instance.

```shell
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest
```

```shell
docker run --name sql_2019_1436 -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "SA_PASSWORD=1Secure*Password1" -e "MSSQL_PID=Enterprise" -p 1436:1433 -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest
```

If you are using docker, you will need to update your connection string in Program.cs to point localhost,1436, and the sa username and password.

```csharp
string connectionString = "Server=localhost,1436;Database=EntityFrameworkExample;ConnectRetryCount=0;User ID=sa;Password=1Secure*Password1";
```

{{< alert class="danger">}}
In production, do not use sa for your database connection and do not hard code the connection in your Program.cs.
{{</ alert >}}

## Create Controllers for Blog and Post

Next, we need to create a controller for Blog and Post to be able to perform CRUD operations. We are going to use the dotnet cli to scaffold the controller.

We have a few packages to add:

```shell
dotnet add package Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design
```

```shell
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
```

```shell
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
```

Next, we need to install the ASP.NET Code Generator global tool.

```shell
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-aspnet-codegenerator
```

Now, we are ready to scaffold the Blog controller.

```shell
dotnet aspnet-codegenerator controller -name BlogController -async -api -m Blog -dc EntityFrameworkExampleContext -outD ir Controllers
```

and the Post controller

```shell
dotnet aspnet-codegenerator controller -name PostController -async -api -m Post -dc EntityFrameworkExampleContext -outDir Controllers
```

## Create Database

Before running our WebApi, we need to create our database and database tables. I will use EntityFramework's migration tool to create scripts that are then applied to our database.

1. We need to install the EF Core tools

    ```shell
    dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
    ```

1. To create our database migration script and save it to the  EntityFramework\Migrations\ directory, run:

    ```shell
    dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate -o .\EntityFramework\Migrations
    ```

1. To run the script against our database, we need to call the database update command for dotnet ef.

    ```shell
    dotnet ef database update
    ```

You are now ready to start the project and navigate to the /swagger url and test out the controller. You should see the following Swagger screen.

![Swagger UI](/images/efcore/soft-deletes/swagger.png)

> Right now, it does not have soft deletes enabled, but before implementing soft deletes, we want to make sure that the basic API is working.

## Add IsDeleted Column to Tables

To make it easy to make sure that all tables get the IsDeleted field added to them, we are going to create a base class that will contain the IsDeleted and Id columns so that we do not have to remember to add it to each table.

1. Create directory EntityFramework\Entities\Base

    ```text
    Base
    ```

1. In the Base directory, create a file named IEntityBase.cs.

    ```text
    IEntityBase.cs
    ```

1. The IEntityBase.cs will be an interface that will define our default columns and needs the following code for the Id and IsDeleted columns

    ```csharp
    namespace EntityFrameworkExample.Entities;

    public interface IEntityBase
    {
        int Id { get; set; }

        bool IsDeleted { get; set; }
    }
    ```

1. In the Base directory, create a file named EntityBase.cs which will be used to implement the Id and IsDeleted columns. We will use an abstract class to ensure that we never directly create a new EntityBase class.

    ```text
    EntityBase.cs
    ```

1. Add the following code to the EntityBase.cs to implement the Id and IsDeleted column. The Id column will be defined as an auto-incrementing column for Sql Server.

    ```csharp
    using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
    using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema;

    namespace EntityFrameworkExample.Entities;

    public abstract class EntityBase : IEntityBase
    {
        [Key, DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]
        public int Id { get; set; }

        public bool IsDeleted { get; set; }
    }
    ```

Now that we have our base class for our entities, we need to update Blog and Post to use the base class.

1. Update the class definition for Blog to inherit from EntityBase

    ```csharp
    public class Blog : EntityBase
    ```

1. From the Blog class remove the Id definition since it is now included in the base class.
1. Update the class definition for Post to inherit from EntityBase

    ```csharp
    public class Post : EntityBase
    ```

1. From the Post class remove the Id definition since it is now included in the base class.
1. We need to create a migration for adding the IsDeleted column to Blog and Post.

    ```shell
    dotnet ef migrations add AddIsDeleted -o .\EntityFramework\Migrations\
    ```

1. Then, we need to apply the migration script to our database

    ```shell
    dotnet ef database update
    ```

## Update Database Context to Override Delete Operation

Now we are ready to change how EF Core runs the delete operations so that it sets the IsDeleted flag to true and leaves the record in the database. We will do this by updating our DbContext to override the save methods to change all delete operations from an entity that inherits from IEntityBase into an update operation that sets the IsDeleted to true.

Before we update our DbContext file, we are going to create an extension method that will take in an EF Core ChangeTracker and modify the entities that EF Core is going to delete.

1. Create the directory, EntityFramework\Extensions

    ```shell
    Extensions
    ```

1. Create the file, EntityFramework\Extensions\ChangeTrackerExtension.cs

    ```shell
    ChangeTrackerExtension.cs
    ```

1. Add the following code to ChangeTrackerExtension.cs to get all entities that inherit from IEntityBase and are part of the delete operation and then update the entity to have the IsDeleted set to true and make it an update operation instead so that the record stays in the database.

    ```csharp
    using EntityFrameworkExample.Entities;
    using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
    using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.ChangeTracking;

    namespace EntityFrameworkExample.Extensions;

    public static class ChangeTrackerExtensions
    {
        public static void SetAuditProperties(this ChangeTracker changeTracker)
        {
            changeTracker.DetectChanges();
            IEnumerable<EntityEntry> entities =
                changeTracker
                    .Entries()
                    .Where(t => t.Entity is IEntityBase && t.State == EntityState.Deleted);

            if (entities.Any())
            {
                foreach(EntityEntry entry in entities)
                {
                    IEntityBase entity = (IEntityBase)entry.Entity;
                    entity.IsDeleted = true;
                    entry.State = EntityState.Modified;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

Now we are ready to update our DbContext to use the ChangeTracker Extension we just created. We need to override four methods in our DbContext file (EntityFrameworkExampleContext.cs) to call the ChangeTracker before saving the changes.

1. SaveChangesAsync (CancellationToken cancellationToken)

    ```csharp
        public override async  Task<int> SaveChangesAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        ChangeTracker.SetAuditProperties();
        return await base.SaveChangesAsync(cancellationToken);
    }
    ```

1. SaveChangesAsync (bool acceptAllChangesOnSuccess, CancellationToken cancellationToken)

    ```csharp
    public override async Task<int> SaveChangesAsync(bool acceptAllChangesOnSuccess, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        ChangeTracker.SetAuditProperties();
        return await base.SaveChangesAsync(acceptAllChangesOnSuccess, cancellationToken);
    }
    ```

1. SaveChanges

    ```csharp
    public override int SaveChanges()
    {
        ChangeTracker.SetAuditProperties();
        return base.SaveChanges();
    }
    ```

1. SaveChanges(bool acceptAllChangesOnSuccess)

    ```csharp
    public override int SaveChanges(bool acceptAllChangesOnSuccess)
    {
        ChangeTracker.SetAuditProperties();
        return base.SaveChanges(acceptAllChangesOnSuccess);
    }
    ```

1. Add the using statement for the ChangeTrackerExtension to the Context file

    ```csharp
    using EntityFrameworkExample.Extensions;
    ```

You are now ready to test that the IsDelete works:

1. Run the application and go to the Swagger UI (/swagger)
1. On the Blog,  run the post operation to insert a new Blog
1. Grab the Id value from the Blog
1. Run the delete operation for the Blog Id
1. Run the get call for the Blogs and notice that the record is still there, but the IsDelete is set to true.

## Filter Out Deleted Rows

At this point, our soft delete is working, but in most cases, we want to filter out records with IsDelete set to true. We could do this by adding a where clause onto all of our queries, but there is a much easier way which is to use an EF Core Global filter for each entity.

Even though we could add the global filter onto each entity, there is a high likely hood that you will forget to do it at least once. Instead, we can implement an EntityTypeConfiguration that allows us to add default configurations for each entity that inherits from it and configurations specific to that entity like indexes.

1. Create the directory EntityFramework\Maps

    ```shell
    Maps
    ```

1. Create the directory EntityFramework\Maps\Base

    ```shell
    Base
    ```

1. Create the EntityFramework\Maps\Base\IEntityMapBase.cs

    ```shell
    IEntityMapBase.cs
    ```

1. Add the following code to the IEntityMapBase.cs

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

    namespace EntityFrameworkExample.Maps;

    public interface IEntityMap<TEntity> : IEntityTypeConfiguration<TEntity> where TEntity : class
    {

    }
    ```

1. Create the file EntityFramework\Maps\Base\EntityMapBase.cs

    ```shell
    EntityMapBase.cs
    ```

1. Add the following code to the EntityMapBase.cs to set the HasQueryFilter property.

    ```csharp
    using EntityFrameworkExample.Entities;

    using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Metadata.Builders;

    namespace EntityFrameworkExample.Maps;

    public abstract class EntityMapBase<TEntity> : IEntityMap<TEntity> where TEntity : class, IEntityBase
    {
        public virtual void Configure(EntityTypeBuilder<TEntity> builder)
        {
            builder.HasQueryFilter(t => t.IsDeleted == false);
        }
    }
    ```

Now we are ready to create the EntityMap configuration for our Blog and Post entities.

1. Create the file EntityFramework\Maps\BlogMap.cs

    ```shell
    BlogMap.cs
    ```

1. Add the following code to the BlogMap.cs to implement the EntityMap.  Right now, we are not adding more configurations like indexes, but if you did need to do that, you would add it in the Configure method after the call to the base configures.

    ```csharp
    using EntityFrameworkExample.Entities;

    using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Metadata.Builders;

    namespace EntityFrameworkExample.Maps;

    public class BlogMap : EntityMapBase<Blog>
    {
        public override void Configure(EntityTypeBuilder<Blog> builder)
        {
            base.Configure(builder);
        }
    }
    ```

1. Create the file EntityFramework\Maps\PostMap.cs

    ```shell
    PostMap.cs
    ```

1. Add the following code to the PostMap.cs to implement the EntityMap.  Right now, we are not adding more configurations like indexes, but if you did need to do that, you would add it in the Configure method after the call to the base configure.

    ```csharp
    using EntityFrameworkExample.Entities;
    using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Metadata.Builders;

    namespace EntityFrameworkExample.Maps;

    public class PostMap : EntityMapBase<Post>
    {
        public override void Configure(EntityTypeBuilder<Post> builder)
        {
            base.Configure(builder);
        }
    }
    ```

1. Now, we need to tell our DbContext (EntityFrameworkExampleContext), about the EntityMap configuration for our Blog and Post entities by overriding the OnModelCreating method

    ```csharp
    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        modelBuilder.ApplyConfiguration(new BlogMap());
        modelBuilder.ApplyConfiguration(new PostMap());
    }
    ```

1. Add the using statement to the DbContext for the BlogMap and PostMap

    ```csharp
    using EntityFrameworkExample.Maps;
    ```

If you start up the application and run the get call for Blog, you will see that it no longer returns the record with the IsDelete set to true as it did before. If you need to write a query to return the IsDeleted is true records, on the individual queries, you would add a call to IgnoreQueryFilters() as part of the query.

Whew, you made it. I know it was a lot of steps and code to walk through, but you did it and completed the implementation of EF Core soft deletes. If you found this post helpful, please share this post on Twitter and Facebook using the share buttons below.
