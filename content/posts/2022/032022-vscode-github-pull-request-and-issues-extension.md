In this series, we are looking at some of my favorite VS Code extensions.

Extensions in VS Code are invaluable to speed up your work and make you more productive.

In this post, we will look at the GitHub Pull Request and Issues extension that allows you to stay where you are writing your code and manage your GitHub pull requests and issues right from VS Code
