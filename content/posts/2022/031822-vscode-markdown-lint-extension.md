## Why You Need Markdownlint

Markdown is designed to be easy to read, write, and understand which it succeeds at.  However, its flexibility is both a benefit and a drawback. There are many possible styles, so formatting can be inconsistent which impacts how your markdown parser is rendering your markdown.

## Usage

Markdownlint includes 50 rules to encourage standards and consistency for Markdown files.

By default, markdownlint will run as you are typing and any lines that violate one of markdownlint's rules will trigger a warning in the editor. Warnings are indicated by a wavy underline and can also be seen by pressing Ctrl+Shift+M/⇧⌘M to open the Errors and Warnings dialog.
