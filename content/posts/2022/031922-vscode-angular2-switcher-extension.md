## Why You Need Angular2 Switcher

I love keyboard shortcuts and not having to leave the keyboard for the mouse.  I find mousing tends to aggravate my shoulder over time, so anything I can do to avoid that is awesome.

When coding using Angular, I frequently switch between my template file (html), stylesheet (scss), and typescript (.ts) files.   With Angular2 Switcher installer, you get keyboard shortcuts to switch between the files.  It is quicker than opening up the sidebar, mousing over to the file, and clicking to open it.

## Usage

Here are the keyboard shortcuts.

|Action  |  Windows  |     macOS     |
| - | :-------: | :-----------: |
|go to `.html`<br>if on `.html` then go to previous | alt+o | shift+alt+o
|go to `.css`<br>if on `.css` then go to previous | alt+i | shift+alt+i
|go to `.ts`<br>if on `.ts` then go to previous | alt+u | shift+alt+u
|go to `.spec.ts`<br>if on `.spec.ts` then go to previous | alt+p | shift+alt+p

> If you have a StreamDeck, you can also add buttons for the shortcuts so that you dont have to remember the shortcuts.  Yes, I know you are leaving the keyboard to use the StreamDeck, but pushing a button doesn't bother me like mousing does.
