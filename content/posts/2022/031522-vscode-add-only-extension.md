## Usage

I write and run a lot of UI tests and one of the things I am constantly doing is adding and removing `.only` to run sets of tests.  The Add Only extensions puts an "Add Only" or "Remove Only" option right above the describe, context, test, and it.

> You need to have CodeLens enabled for this to work
