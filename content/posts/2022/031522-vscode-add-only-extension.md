Extension in VS Code are invaluable to speed up your work and make you more productive.  I have several extension installed and in this post we are going to take a quick look at one of my favorites for testing called Add Only.

I write and run a lot of UI tests and one of the things I am constantly doing is adding and removing `.only` to run sets of tests.  The Add Only extensions puts an "Add Only" or "Remove Only" option right above the describe, context, test, and it.
