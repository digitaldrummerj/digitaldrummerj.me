Extension in VS Code are invaluable to speed up your work and make you more productive.  In this series, we are taking a look at some of my favorite VS Code extensions.

In this post, we are going to look at Add Only to quickly add or remove a `.Only` to your tests.

I write and run a lot of UI tests and one of the things I am constantly doing is adding and removing `.only` to run sets of tests.  The Add Only extensions puts an "Add Only" or "Remove Only" option right above the describe, context, test, and it.
