This is one of my most used extensions. Being able to quickly collapse or expand just the sections that I care about in a file using a single command is a great productivity boost.

Fold Plus adds these additional Fold commands into VS Code:

* Fold All Same Level as Cursor
* Fold All ame Level as Parent
* Fold All with Selected Text
* Fold All Keep Selected Text
* Fold All Keep Cursor Live
* Fold Parent
* Fold Children
* Unfold All Lines Matching
* Unfold All Same Level as Cursor
* Unfold All with Selected Text
