## What Fold Plus Does

It is such a great productivity boost to be able to quickly collapse or expand just the sections that I care about in a file using a single command.

Fold Plus adds several additional commands into VS Code:

* Fold All Same Level as Cursor
* Fold All Same Level as Parent
* Fold All with Selected Text
* Fold All Keep Selected Text
* Fold All Keep Cursor Live
* Fold Parent
* Fold Children
* Unfold All Lines Matching
* Unfold All Same Level as Cursor
* Unfold All with Selected Text

To use Fold Plus, pull up the command pallete, type Fold or Unfold and pick the fold command you want.

> I use Fold All Same Level as Cursor and Unfold All Same Level as Cursor the most
