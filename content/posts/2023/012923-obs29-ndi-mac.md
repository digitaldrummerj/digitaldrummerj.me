I just got a Mac Mini M2 and needed to get OBS 29 (latest version) working with NDI but no matter what I did I kept getting the following error everytime I started OBS.

## Initial Install

Initially, I tried the following as this is what the [OBS NDI plugin](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-ndi-newtek-ndiâ„¢-integration-into-obs-studio.528/) recommended but it is what led to the error above.

1. Install [OBS](https://obsproject.com/download)
1. Install the [OBS NDI 4.5 Runtime](https://ndi.palakis.fr/runtime/ndi-runtime-4.5.1-macOS.pkg)
1. Install the [obs-ndi-4.10.1-macos-arm64.pkg](https://github.com/DDRBoxman/obs-ndi/releases/tag/4.10.1)

Upon launching OBS, you will get the NDI runtime is missing error

## Fixing the NDI Runtime Missing Error

No matter how many times I download the OBS NDI 4.5 runtime, the error kept popping up.

To fix the error, I needed to close OBS, install the NDI Tools from NewTek and copy the libndi_advanced.dylib to the /usr/local/lib folder as libndi.4.dylib

1. Quit OBS
1. Install the [NDI Tools](https://www.ndi.tv/tools/)
1. Reboot your Mac
1. Open a terminal and run the following command to copy the libndi lib to the right place

  ```shell
  sudo cp "/Applications/NDI Video Monitor.app/Contents/Frameworks/libndi_advanced.dylib" "/usr/local/lib/libndi.4.dylib"
  ```

## Verify NDI Is Working

1. Open OBS and the NDI Runtime missing error should not appear
1. Under the tools menu you have the NDI Output settings option
1. In a scene you can add an NDI Source
