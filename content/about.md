I have been programming, designing, and testing web applications for over 20 years.  I love to share my knowledge with others to help get you to your end goals faster.  I am a frequent speaker at conferences, meetups and community events.

My typical tech stack is Angular, .NET Core, SQL Server, and Cypress.

I also own a company called Let Your Nerd Be Heard where we turn virtual events into extraordinary experiences that transform audiences and generate wealth.

If you would like me to speak at your event, please [drop me a line]({{< relref "contact.md" >}}).  I can cover pretty much any topic you see me blog about but feel free to request just about anything.

If you see me at an event, please be sure to come up and say "Hi".  The best part of the events is hanging out with other developers.

**This blog, its content, and opinions are my own.**
