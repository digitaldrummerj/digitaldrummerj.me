### <a name="angulartesting"></a>Angular Unit Testing from the Trenches

For a number of years now we have been hearing about all of the benefits that automated unit testing provides like increasing our quality, catching errors earlier, ensuring that all developers are testing in the same manner and deploying updates with high confidence that nothing will break. Testing a Web UI though was difficult and fragile which meant that typically we had no automated unit test for our Web UI. This is no longer the case with the latest release of Angular. Unit testing is now a first class citizen in Angular.

Out of the box, the project generated by the Angular CLI has unit testing setup with Karma and Jasmine and includes sample tests. Generating new components, services, and pipes includes the unit test Spec file already wired up. Thus allowing you to focus on writing your unit tests and not on the infrastructure needed to get them running. The barriers to writing unit test have been destroyed.

This talk will walk through getting started unit testing your Angular components, services, and pipes. Along the way I will share the tips and tricks that I have learned as I have implemented unit testing on my Angular projects at a Fortune 100 company. You will walk away ready to immediately implement unit testing on your Angular project.

### <a name="taco"></a>Build mobile apps for iOS, Android, and Windows using JavaScript

Mobile application development does not need to be difficult for us Web Developers. No longer do we need to learn a whole slew of new programming languages to create a mobile application. We can use our existing skills and create mobile applications with Html, JavaScript, and CSS. Then deploy to Android and iOS devices using a single code base that looks, feels, and performs like a native mobile application.

Visual Studio Tools For Apache Cordova (TACO) takes the pain out of getting your mobile development environment up and running. You can do all of your coding, testing, and debugging of your mobile application right inside of Visual Studio.

Along with the Ionic framework templates, you will be able to get your mobile app created in record time. The Ionic framework takes the worry out of making the UI look, feel and perform correctly on the slew different Apple and Android devices that your users will have. You will be able to focus on your business logic and not the underlying infrastructure.

In this talk we will dive into the Visual Studio TACO features, how to get it all setup, take a quick glance at the Ionic framework and finish off by creating a sample application. You will walk away from this talk with all of the tools that you need to deliver your first mobile application

### <a name="chocolatey"></a> Chocolatey - making the process of installing software on windows easy as pie

Chocolatey is a machine package manager somewhat like apt-get for Linux but built for Windows. No more searching for the install download or trying to figure out 32/64 bit or wonder what options to pick. Chocolatey takes care of doing the install for you and you can even create scripts to install multiple packages. With Chocolatey you can bring up a new development machine with minimal effort. By the end of this session you will have all of the information you need to be both a consumer and create of Chocolatey packages.Chocolatey isn't just for system administrators. It is extremely useful for both developers and end-users as well.For developers, you can quickly bring up a new machine and get all of your software installed on it with minimal effort. It is also very easy to make Chocolatey packages for your software and distribute it to your users.For end-users, no longer will they need to search for where to download your software or how to install it. Chocolatey will do all of the work for them.

### <a name="travisci"></a>Continuous Integration with Github and TravisCI

Come learn how easy it is to implement continuous integration using TravisCI every time you push your commits to Github.   

If you don't know what continuous integration is, it is where on push to your version control system, an automated build is kicked off that ensure that all of your tests and compilation works on a machine that mirrors production and is not your laptop.

### <a name="backand"></a>Designing a Restful Api in Minutes with Backand

Are you like me  and dislike having to waste time crafting an API for standard CRUD operations?  Are you a front-end developer that doesn't want to become a database expert in order to create your Restful Api?  Then worst of all after once you do finally finish crafting your API, you have to figure out how to host it and get it deployed.   This takes a lot of time away from you being able to focus on your UI and getting it out to the market. 
 
Back& can take all of this pain away and allow you to focus on your UI and not crafting your API.  Create your data model and Back& will generate the Restful Api for you.  If you already have a database, just point Back& to it and Back& will generate the Restful Api from that database.  If you also need user/password authentication, social login authentication, server side logic, or hosting, Back& has you covered here as well.  
 
In this session, we will examine the features of Back& , walk through the creation of an API, hook the API up to an AngularJS application and then deploy it to the Back& hosting.

### <a name="cloudapishootout"></a>Data Driven Restful Api Creation Made Easy Breezy


 Are you tired of writing CRUD based APIs?  Wish you could fast track your Api development so that you can focus on your UI?  Don't want to become an API/Hosting expert just to get a basic API in the Cloud?  Then this session is for you.  Creating and Hosting a Restful Api for standard CRUD operations should be an easy task and not one that slows down your applications development.   In this session, we examine the pros/cons my favorite Cloud based API providers (Firebase, Back& and Strongloop) and then we will create an API in each.  You will be able to see how with these 3 Cloud API providers how easy it is to create a full Restful Api in under 10 minutes.

### <a name="introgit"></a>Intro to Version Control with Git and Github


Being able to understand and use version control is a critical part of being a software developer. Version control allows you (and your team) to collaborate, track, and revert changes to your code, documentation and samples. One very popular version control is Git. In this talk we will cover the basics of using Git, show how to publish and share your code through the GitHub, and how to contribute to an open source project using Git and Github.

You will walk away from this talk ready to use Git and Github to manage all of your code assets and know how to contribute to open source projects.

If you want to follow along with the examples, bring your laptop with install the Git command line from https://git-scm.com/download/  and have a Github account created at https://github.com if you do not already have one.

### <a name="nuget"></a>Nuget is easier than you think and you should be using it as both a consumer and creator of packages

Nuget is a package manager for Visual Studio that allows you to easily share assets (dll, javascript, c#, etc files) and use them in your project.  Most Visual Studio developers have consumer nuget packages but few have created and shared nuget packages.  It is amazingly easy to create and publish a nuget package.  In less than 60 minutes I will show you how move from a consumer to a creator.  You will learn how to package up dll's, source code that needs to be inserted in a project, add/change configurations, publish a package and host your own nuget feed.

### <a name="sails"></a>Rapid API Development with Node and Sails

Creating a RESTful API should be the easiest part of your development. You should not have to be a rocket scientist to successfully create a RESTful API. With Sails, you can create a full featured RESTful API in just a few minutes without writing any code. You get create, destroy, update, find, paginate, sort, and filtering out of the box. If you need to add your business logic to any of the methods or create your own methods, you can do that by writing simple JavaScript functions.

When you are ready to implement your security layer, Sails has you covered. Sails provides basic security and role-based access in the form of policies that can be applied any REST action. Policies are interchangeable with Express/Connect middleware which means you can plugin in popular NPM modules such as Passport. You can also easily implement your own email/password, social login or Windows authentication with a bit of JavaScript.

For data storage, Sails bundles the power ORM, Waterline, which provides a simple data access layer that just works, no matter what database you are using. Out of the box MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Redis are support. However, there are more than 30 data storage providers adapter that the community has created such as Microsoft SQL Server, Couchbase, Salesforce, and Firebase. You can easily switch between any data storage provider or mix and match data storage providers on a model by model basis.

This talk will be code heavy as we walk through getting started with Sails and demonstrate how to implement the features of Sails through the creation of an API.

### <a name="uprunangular"></a>Up and Running with Angular

If you have ever wanted to code an application with Angular this is your chance. Join us for a fun filled day of learning Angular in this hands-on workshop. You will go from 0 to 60 with your Angular knowledge and be able to create our own Angular applications by the end of this workshop. We will start with a new project and continue to build up the project until we have a full application at the end.

Topics Covered

What is Angular and the different parts that make up Angular?
Angular CLI Overview
Angular project layout overview
Creating common components like headers, footers, and menus.
Applying CSS to just a single component vs the whole site
Creating new components (pages)
Routing between components (pages)
Calling an external http service
Preparing your application for deployment
Adding authorization checks to routes (if time permits)
Testing overview (if time permits and our brains aren’t already full with Angular knowledge)

Labs: [http://digitaldrummerj.me/angular-tutorial](http://digitaldrummerj.me/angular-tutorial)


#### Pre-Requisite Knowledge:

* Html and CSS
* Understanding of how events like click work in Html/JavaScript
* TypeScript is helpful but we will cover the needed knowledge if you do not have any TypeScript experience

#### Pre-Work:

* Node LTS 6.x (https://nodejs.org)
* Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com)
* Angular CLI (npm install -g @angular/cli)
* Create a new Angular project using the Angular CLI
* Open Command Prompt or Terminal
* Navigate to c:\ on Windows and ~/ on Osx
* Run: mkdir projects
* Run: cd projects
* Run: ng new ng2ws –style scss –routing
* Run: ng serve
* Open browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200 and you should see the default web page for your Angular application
